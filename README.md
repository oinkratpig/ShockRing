# ShockRing

Shock you IRL when you take damage in Elden Ring.

Not working yet. See https://github.com/oinkratpig/ShockRing/milestone/1.

# NEEDS EAC TO BE DISABLED

Easiest way to do this:
1. Navigate to Elden Ring's "Game" folder (the one with "eldenring.exe").
2. Create a new file called "steam_appid.txt" in this folder.
3. Open "steam_appid.txt", type "1245620", and hit save (the file should contain nothing except "1245620").
4. Launch "eldenring.exe" through the folder. DO NOT open through Steam or nothing different will happen.
5. If it worked, Elden Ring will launch with EAC disabled. The game will force offline mode. The game will tell you "inappropriate activity detected" - don't worry, that just means offline is now disabled.
6. ShockRing should work now.
